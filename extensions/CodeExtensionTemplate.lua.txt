-- This is a template for a custom code extension for the Ironmon Tracker.
-- To use, first rename both this top-most function and the return value at the bottom: "CodeExtensionTemplate" -> "YourFileNameHere"
-- Then fill in each function you want to use with the code you want executed during Tracker runtime.
-- The name, author, and description attribute fields are used by the Tracker to identify this extension, please always include them.
-- You can safely remove unused functions; they won't be called.

local function CodeExtensionTemplate()
	-- Define descriptive attributes of the custom extension that are displayed on the Tracker settings
	local self = {}
	self.version = "1.0"
	self.name = "My Fancy Extension"
	self.author = "My Username"
	self.description = "This is a template file for my fancy custom code extension."
	self.github = "MyUsername/ExtensionRepo" -- Replace "MyUsername" and "ExtensionRepo" to match your GitHub repo url, if any
	self.url = string.format("https://github.com/%s", self.github or "") -- Remove this attribute if no host website available for this extension

	--------------------------------------
	-- INTENRAL TRACKER FUNCTIONS BELOW
	-- Add any number of these below functions to your extension that you want to use.
	-- If you don't need a function, don't add it at all; leave ommitted for faster code execution.
	-- IMPORTANT: To repeat, do NOT use all of these functions. Comment out or omit them. Otherwise performance will suffer.
	--------------------------------------

	-- Executed when the user clicks the "Options" button while viewing the extension details within the Tracker's UI
	-- Remove this function if you choose not to include a way for the user to configure options for your extension
	-- NOTE: You'll need to implement a way to save & load changes for your extension options, similar to Tracker's Settings.ini file
	function self.configureOptions()
		-- [ADD CODE HERE]
	end

	-- Executed when the user clicks the "Check for Updates" button while viewing the extension details within the Tracker's UI
	-- The existence of this function will allow the Tracker to automatically update & install your extension if an update is available
	-- Your extension needs to define the `self.github` and `self.url` value in order for this auto-update to work
	-- Returns [true, downloadUrl] if an update is available (downloadUrl auto opens in browser for user); otherwise returns [false, downloadUrl]
	function self.checkForUpdates()
		-- Update the pattern below to match your version. You can check what this looks like by visiting the latest release url on your repo
		local versionResponsePattern = '"tag_name":%s+"%w+(%d+%.%d+)"' -- matches "1.0" in "tag_name": "v1.0"
		local versionCheckUrl = string.format("https://api.github.com/repos/%s/releases/latest", self.github or "")
		local downloadUrl = string.format("%s/releases/latest", self.url or "")
		local compareFunc = function(a, b) return a ~= b and not Utils.isNewerVersion(a, b) end -- if current version is *older* than online version
		local isUpdateAvailable = Utils.checkForVersionUpdate(versionCheckUrl, self.version, versionResponsePattern, compareFunc)
		return isUpdateAvailable, downloadUrl
	end

	-- Executed when the user clicks the "Check for Updates" or "Update All Extensions" button
	-- NOTE: Only add this function to your extension if you need to override how the update is performed.
	-- Defining this function is optional. The below code is the default code the Tracker uses for all extensions that have a `self.github` or `self.url` value defined.
	-- Returns [true] if the auto-update is successful; false otherwise
	function self.downloadAndInstallUpdate()
		-- Note: After the extension files are downloaded from Github and unzipped, you may have extra files in there that aren't needed for the extension to work
		-- Refer to the documentation in TrackerAPI to learn more about how to exclude these files/folders, as well as how to download from a specific release branch
		local extensionFilenameKey = "CodeExtensionTemplate" -- REPLACE WITH FILENAME OF EXTENSION
		local success = TrackerAPI.updateExtension(extensionFilenameKey)
		return success
	end

	-- Executed only once: When the extension is enabled by the user, and/or when the Tracker first starts up, after it loads all other required files and code
	function self.startup()
		-- [ADD CODE HERE]
	end

	-- Executed only once: When the extension is disabled by the user, necessary to undo any customizations, if able
	function self.unload()
		-- [ADD CODE HERE]
	end

	-- Executed once every 30 frames, after most data from game memory is read in
	function self.afterProgramDataUpdate()
		-- [ADD CODE HERE]
	end

	-- Executed once every 30 frames, after any battle related data from game memory is read in
	function self.afterBattleDataUpdate()
		-- [ADD CODE HERE]
	end

	-- Executed once every 30 frames or after any redraw event is scheduled (i.e. most button presses)
	function self.afterRedraw()
		-- [ADD CODE HERE]
	end

	-- Executed before a button's onClick() is processed, and only once per click per button
	-- Param: button: the button object being clicked
	function self.onButtonClicked(button)
		-- [ADD CODE HERE]
	end

	-- Executed after a new battle begins (wild or trainer), and only once per battle
	function self.afterBattleBegins()
		-- [ADD CODE HERE]
	end

	-- Executed after a battle ends, and only once per battle
	function self.afterBattleEnds()
		-- [ADD CODE HERE]
	end

	-- [Bizhawk only] Executed each frame (60 frames per second)
	-- CAUTION: Avoid unnecessary calculations here, as this can easily affect performance.
	function self.inputCheckBizhawk()
		-- Uncomment to use, otherwise leave commented out
			-- local mouseInput = input.getmouse() -- lowercase 'input' pulls directly from Bizhawk API
			-- local joypadButtons = Input.getJoypadInputFormatted() -- uppercase 'Input' uses Tracker formatted input
		-- [ADD CODE HERE]
	end

	-- [MGBA only] Executed each frame (60 frames per second)
	-- CAUTION: Avoid unnecessary calculations here, as this can easily affect performance.
	function self.inputCheckMGBA()
		-- Uncomment to use, otherwise leave commented out
			-- local joypadButtons = Input.getJoypadInputFormatted()
		-- [ADD CODE HERE]
	end

	-- Executed each frame of the game loop, after most data from game memory is read in but before any natural redraw events occur
	-- CAUTION: Avoid code here if possible, as this can easily affect performance. Most Tracker updates occur at 30-frame intervals, some at 10-frame.
	function self.afterEachFrame()
