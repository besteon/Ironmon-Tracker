-- This is a template for a custom code extension for the Ironmon Tracker.
-- To use, first rename both this top-most function and the return value at the bottom: "CodeExtensionTemplate" -> "YourFileNameHere"
-- Then fill in each function you want to use with the code you want executed during Tracker runtime.
-- The name, author, and description attribute fields are used by the Tracker to identify this extension, please always include them.
-- You can safely remove unused functions; they won't be called.

	-- Executed once every 30 frames, after most data from game memory is read in

		-- [ADD CODE HERE]
	end

	-- Executed once every 30 frames, after any battle related data from game memory is read in
	function self.afterBattleDataUpdate()
